# Soccer Master Project

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files for the **Soccer Master Project**, which involves data analysis and model development related to soccer statistics and transfer prices.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and notebooks:

*   **`/` (Root Directory):**
    *   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
    *   `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis notebook (formerly `soccer_master_eda.ipynb`).
    *   `LICENSE`: Contains the project's license information (MIT License).
*   **`/models`:** Contains subdirectories for different modeling approaches.
    *   **`/models/fnn`:** Contains files related to the custom FNN model.
        *   `fnn.ipynb`: Notebook for training and evaluating the custom-built FNN model. [Model Readme](models/fnn/README.md)
    *   **`/models/regressor`:** Contains files related to the ensemble machine learning model.
        *   `regressor.ipynb`: Notebook for training and evaluating the ensemble machine learning model. [Model Readme](models/regressor/README.md)

## Notebook Descriptions

1.  **`EDA.ipynb` (Exploratory Data Analysis):**
    *   Located in the root directory (`/`).
    *   Purpose: This notebook focuses on exploring and understanding the dataset. It includes:
        *   Data loading and cleaning.
        *   Statistical summaries of key variables.
        *   Data visualizations to uncover patterns and insights relevant to player transfer prices.
        *   Generating the `transfers_data.csv` file used by the models.

2.  **`models/fnn/fnn.ipynb` (Custom FNN Model):**
    *   Located in the `/models/fnn` directory.
    *   Purpose: This notebook focuses on building and training a custom Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) from scratch using NumPy to predict soccer player transfer prices. It includes:
        *   Data loading and preprocessing using the `transfers_data.csv` file generated by `EDA.ipynb`.
        *   Definition of the FNN architecture with custom layers and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization.
        *   Training and evaluation of the model.
    *   See the [Model Readme](models/fnn/README.md) for more details.

3.  **`models/regressor/regressor.ipynb` (Ensemble Machine Learning Model):**
    *   Located in the `/models/regressor` directory.
    *   Purpose: This notebook focuses on building and training an ensemble machine learning model to predict soccer player transfer prices. It includes:
        *   Data loading and preprocessing using the `transfers_data.csv` file generated by `EDA.ipynb`.
        *   Training and hyperparameter optimization of individual regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting).
        *   Creation of an ensemble model using a `VotingRegressor`.
        *   Evaluation of the ensemble model's performance.
    *   See the [Model Readme](models/regressor/README.md) for more details.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

*   Python (version 3.7 or higher)
*   Jupyter Notebook
*   pandas
*   numpy
*   scikit-learn
*   matplotlib
*   seaborn
*   xgboost
*   joblib

Install the required packages using:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost joblib
```
## Usage

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/devparikh0506/soccer_master/tree/main
    cd soccer_master
    ```

2.  **Run the Notebooks in Order:** It's important to run the notebooks in the following order to ensure data dependencies are met.

    *   **[`EDA.ipynb`](EDA.ipynb):**
        *   Navigate to the root directory (`/`).
        *   Start a Jupyter Notebook server: `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`
        *   Open `EDA.ipynb` and run all cells. This will generate the `transfers_data.csv` file required by the models.
    *   **[`models/fnn/fnn.ipynb`](models/fnn/fnn.ipynb):**
        *   Navigate to the `models/fnn` directory: `cd models/fnn`
        *   Start a Jupyter Notebook server: `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`
        *   Open `fnn.ipynb` and run all cells.  **Important:** Make sure to update the path to the `transfers_data.csv` file in the notebook to reflect its location in the `data` directory.
    *   **[`models/regressor/regressor.ipynb`](models/regressor/regressor.ipynb):**
        *   Navigate to the `models/regressor` directory: `cd models/regressor`
        *   Start a Jupyter Notebook server: `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`
        *   Open `regressor.ipynb` and run all cells. **Important:** Make sure to update the path to the `transfers_data.csv` file in the notebook to reflect its location in the `data` directory.
